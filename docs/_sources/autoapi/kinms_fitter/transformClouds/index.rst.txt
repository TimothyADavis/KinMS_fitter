.. py:function:: transformClouds(inclouds, posAng=90.0, inc=0.0, cent=[0.0, 0.0], sbRad=None)

   Transforms skySampler cloudlets for use in KinMS.

   Calculate the galaxy co-ordinates of clouds from the sky plane. This MUST be used if any of the following conditions are true:
   inc != 0
   posAng != 90
   cent != [0,0]

   This exists as a stand-alone routine since an MCMC fit to the galaxy will likely need to run this every step, 
   and the sampleClouds routine is computationally expensive
   ============
   Inputs:

   clouds: np.ndarray The output of the sampleClouds array [x,y,I]

   posAng: 0=<float<360 The position angle of the galaxy major axis, measured from the y-axis of the cube

   inc: 0=<float<90 The inclination of the galaxy, with 90 being edge-on

   cent: [float,float] The photometric centre of the galaxy relative to the centre of the cube

   ============
   Outputs:

   clouds: np.ndarray Positions and intensities of particles [x',y',I]
