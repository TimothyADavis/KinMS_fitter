              assumed to be circular. If a list/array of length two. these are the sizes of the major and minor axes,
              and the position angle is assumed to be 0. If a list/array of length 3, the first 2 elements are the

      :param nSamps: 
              (int) Number of cloudlets to use to create the model. Large numbers will reduce numerical noise (especially
              in large cubes), at the cost of increasing runtime.
      :param diskThick: 
              (numpy array) The disc scaleheight in arcseconds. If a single value then this is used at all radii. If an array/list

          inclination as a function of the radius vector 'velrad' (in order to model warps etc).
      :param posAng:
          (float or int, or list or array of float or int) Position angle (PA) of the disc (a PA of zero means that the redshifted part of the cube is aligned
          with the positive y-axis). If single valued then the disc major axis is straight. If an array is passed
          then it should describe how the position angle changes as a function of `velrad` (so this can be used
          to create position angle warps).
      :param gasSigma: 
          (float or int, or array or list of float or int) Optional, default is value 0.
          Velocity dispersion of the gas (units of km/s). If single valued then the velocity dispersion is
          constant throughout the disc. If an array/list is passed then it should describe how the velocity
          dispersion changes as a function of 'velrad'.
      :param diskThick: 
          (float or int, or array or list of float or int) Optional, default value is 0.
          The disc scaleheight in arcseconds. If a single value then this is used at all radii. If an array/list

      :param flux_clouds: 
          (array or list of float or int) Optional, default value is 0.
          This vector can be used to supply the flux of each point in 'inclouds'. If used alone then total flux
          in the model is equal to total(flux_inclouds). If 'intflux' used then this vector denotes the relative
          brightness of the points in 'inclouds'.
      :param sbProf: 
          (array or list of float or int) Optional, default value is [].

          If your required gas distribution is not symmetric, you may input vectors containing the position of the
          clouds you wish to simulate. This 3-vector should contain the x, y and z positions, in units of
          arcseconds from the phase centre. If this variable is used, then 'diskthick', 'sbrad' and 'sbprof' are
          ignored. Example: inclouds = [[0,0,0], [10,-10,2], ..., [xpos, ypos, zpos]].
      :param vLOS_clouds: 
          (array or list of float or int) Optional, default value is [].
          This vector should contain the LOS velocity for each point defined in 'inclouds', in units of km/s. If
          not supplied then 'inclouds' is assumed to be the -face on- distribution and that 'velprof' or 'velrad'
          should be used, and the distribution projected. If this variable is used then 'gassigma' and 'inc'
          are ignored.
      :param massDist: 
          (list of float) Optional, default value is [].

          Specifies the morphological centre of the disc structure you create with respect to the central pixel
          of the generated cube.
      :param vOffset: 
          (float or int) Optional, default value is 0.
          Offset from the centre of the velocity axis in km/s.
      :param vPosAng: 
          (float or int, or array or list of float or int) Optional, default value is 0.
          Kinematic position angle of the disc, using the usual astronomical convention. If single valued then the
          disc kinematic major axis is straight. If an array is passed then it should describe how the kinematic
          position angle changes as a function of 'velrad'. Used if the kinematic and morphological position
          angles are not the same.
      :param vPhaseCent: 
          (list of float or int of length 2) Optional, default value is [0, 0].
          Kinematic centre of the rotation in the x-y plane. Units of pixels. Used if the kinematic and

          (float) Optional, default value =  230.542e9 (12CO(2-1)).
          Rest frequency of spectral line of choice (in Hz). Only matters if you are outputting a FITS file.                 
      ;param radial_motion_func:
          (callable) Optional, default is to not use. 
          If a method of kinms.radial_motion is supplied then will include the effect of radial (non-circular) motions using
          that formalism. Current options include pure radial flows, along with lopsided and bisymmetric (bar-type) flows.
      :param returnClouds: 
          (bool) Optional, default value is False.
          If set True then KinMS returns the created 'inclouds' and 'vlos_clouds' in addition to the cube.
      ;param toplot:
          (bool) Optional, default value is False.
          Makes a basic plot of your model to screen

      :param fileName: 
          (str) Optional, default value is ''.
          If you wish to save the resulting model to a fits file, set this variable. The output filename will
          be 'filename'_simcube.fits
