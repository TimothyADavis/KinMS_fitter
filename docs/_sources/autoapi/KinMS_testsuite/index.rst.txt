.. py:function:: internet(host='8.8.8.8', port=53, timeout=3)

   Host: 8.8.8.8 (google-public-dns-a.google.com)
   OpenPort: 53/tcp
   Service: domain (DNS/TCP)


.. py:function:: expdisk(scalerad=10, inc=60, fileName=None)

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates how
   to create a simulation of an exponential disk of molecular gas. The user can input values for the scalerad and inc
   variables, and the procedure will the create the simulation and display it to screen.
   :param scalerad: Scale radius for the exponential disk (in arcseconds)
   :param inc: Inclination to project the disk (in degrees)
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: expdisk_gasgrav(scalerad=5, inc=45, gasmass=10000000000.0, distance=16.5)

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to create a simulation of an exponential disk of molecular gas, including the effect of the potential of the gas
   on its own rotation. The user can input values for the scalerad and inc variables, and the procedure will the create
   the simulation and display it to screen.
   :param scalerad: Scale radius for the exponential disk (in arcseconds)
   :param inc: Inclination to project the disk (in degrees)
   :param gasmass: Total mass of the gas (in solar masses)
   :param distance: Distance to the galaxy (in Mpc)
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: ngc4324()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure makes a basic
   simulation of the molecular gas ring in NGC4324, and plots the simulation moment zero, one and PVD against the
   observed ones from the CARMA observations of Alatalo et al., 2012.
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: use_inclouds()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to use the "inclouds" parameter set to create simulations, in this case of a very unrealistic object. Once you
   understand this example then see the "infits" and "inclouds spiral" test for more realistic examples.
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: inclouds_spiral()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to use the "inclouds" parameter set to create simulations, in this case of molecular gas in a two armed spiral
   pattern. Any default parameters can be changed by specifying them at the command line (see KinMS.pro or the full
   details of all the available parameters).
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: infits()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to use an input FITS image to create a simulation of what the molecular gas may look like, with a given
   instrument (in this case CARMA). We use a GALEX (Morrissey et al., 2007) FUV image of NGC1437A, and scale it
   assuming the FUV emission comes from star-formation and thus molecular gas, and that the galaxy has a total
   integrated CO flux of 30 Jy km/s. We use the FITS image to set the surface-brightness, and impose a flat velocity
   gradient.
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: veldisp()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to create a simulation of an exponential disk of molecular gas with a velocity dispersion that varies with
   radius.
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: diskthick()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to create a simulation of an exponential disk of molecular gas with a thickness that varies with radius. Any
   default parameters can be changed by specifying them at the command line (see KinMS.pro for the full details of all
   the available parameters).
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: warp()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to create a simulation of a warped exponential disk of molecular gas.
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: retclouds()

   A test procedure to demonstrate the KinMS code, and check if it works on your system. This procedure demonstrates
   how to use the return clouds feature to recursivly build models - here a misaligned central and outer disc.
   :return: N/A


.. py:function:: run_tests()
